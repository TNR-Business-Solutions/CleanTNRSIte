## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Checkout Cart Functionality** ✅
- **Problem:** Items added to cart weren't showing up
- **Solution:** 
  - Added console logging to debug cart loading
  - Fixed sessionStorage persistence for cart and sessionId
  - Cart now properly loads from sessionStorage on checkout page
  - Added visual feedback when cart is empty

### 2. **Checkout Form Submission** ✅
- **Problem:** Checkout form wouldn't submit
- **Solution:**
  - Created `/api/checkout.js` serverless function for Vercel
  - Added `/checkout` rewrite rule in `vercel.json`
  - Integrated CRM to automatically create orders
  - Sends confirmation emails to both business and customer
  - Form now properly submits with all customer and cart data

### 3. **Umbrella Insurance Form** ✅
- **Problem:** No form on umbrella-insurance.html
- **Solution:**
  - Replaced basic CTA with comprehensive quote form
  - Added fields for:
    - Personal information (name, email, phone, company)
    - Coverage amount ($1M - $5M options)
    - Current policies (home, auto, business)
    - Insurance type (personal/commercial/both)
    - Additional details and contact preferences
  - Integrated with `form-integration-simple.js`
  - Connected to CRM system

### 4. **Vercel Deployment Configuration** ✅
- **Problem:** Build failed with "No Output Directory named 'public' found"
- **Solution:**
  - Set `outputDirectory: "."` in `vercel.json`
  - Configured `buildCommand: "node verify-images.js"`
  - Added rewrites for both `/submit-form` and `/checkout`
