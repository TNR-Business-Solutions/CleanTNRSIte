# Grants.gov Registration Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: UEI Not Found Error

**Error Message:** "Unique Entity ID (UEI) not found - To apply for grants, your organization must be fully registered at SAM.gov."

**Your UEI:** MTBDTB7CYKE9  
**Status:** Submitted Registration (may still be processing)

---

## Why This Is Happening

Your SAM.gov registration shows "Submitted Registration" status, which means:
- ✅ Your registration has been submitted
- ⏳ It may still be processing (takes 7-10 business days)
- ⏳ It may need additional verification
- ⏳ It may not be fully "Active" yet

Grants.gov requires your SAM.gov registration to be **fully active and approved** before you can add an organizational profile.
