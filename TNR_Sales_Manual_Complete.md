## Chapter 10: Closing Deals and Follow-Up Strategies

### 10.1 Closing Techniques

#### 1. Assumptive Close (Most Effective)

**How It Works:** Act as if they've already decided to buy.

**Example:**
*"Perfect! So we'll get you set up with the Premium Package. I'll send the contract via DocuSign—it takes about 5 minutes to sign. Once you sign, we'll schedule the kickoff call for next week. Your site will be live within 3 weeks, and you'll start seeing ranking improvements in 60 days. Sound good?"*

**When to Use:** When they've shown strong interest, asked about next steps, or you've addressed all objections.

#### 2. Alternative Close

**How It Works:** Give them two options, both of which involve buying.

**Example:**
*"So we have two options: The Starter Package at /month gets you the website and basic SEO—perfect if you want to start small and scale up. Or the Premium Package at ,500/month gets you everything—website, full SEO, social media, email, ads, plus a dedicated manager. Which one makes more sense for where you are right now?"*

**When to Use:** When they're interested but unsure which package to choose.

#### 3. Urgency Close

**How It Works:** Create time-sensitive reason to buy now.

**Example:**
*"I have 3 spots left this month for new clients. After that, we're booked for 3 weeks. If we get started by Friday, you'll be live by [date] and ranking by [date]. If you wait, it'll be a 6-7 week delay. Want to lock in your spot?"*

**When to Use:** When you genuinely have limited availability or time-sensitive offer. Only use if true!

#### 4. Risk Reversal Close

**How It Works:** Remove their risk by offering guarantee or trial.

**Example:**
*"I know this is an investment, and I want you to feel confident. Here's what I'll do: If, after 90 days, you're not seeing the improvements we discussed—rankings moving up, traffic increasing, leads coming in—I'll work with you to adjust the strategy at no extra cost. We're not here to take your money and run—we're here to get you results. Does that help?"*

**When to Use:** When they're interested but hesitant about risk.

#### 5. Summary Close

**How It Works:** Summarize what they want and ask for confirmation.

**Example:**
*"Let me make sure I understand: You want to rank #1 for '[keyword]', you need a professional website that converts, and you want to start seeing results in 60 days. Our Premium Package does exactly that for ,500/month. You're ready to move forward, right?"*

**When to Use:** At the end of demo or proposal review.

#### 6. Question Close

**How It Works:** Ask a question that implies they're buying.

**Example:**
*"What's your preferred start date—next week or the week after?"*
*"Should I send the contract to this email address?"*
*"Do you want to pay monthly or quarterly?"*

**When to Use:** When you're 90% sure they're ready to buy, but want final confirmation.

#### 7. Sharp Angle Close

**How It Works:** Agree to their request, but with condition of buying.

**Example:**
**Them:** *"Can you send me a detailed proposal?"*
**You:** *"Absolutely! I can send that today. And if the proposal looks good, are you ready to move forward and get started?"*

**When to Use:** When they ask for something (proposal, case study, reference) before deciding.

### 10.2 Reading Buying Signals

#### Verbal Signals (They're Ready to Buy)

- "How much does it cost?" (after you've shown value)
- "How long does it take?"
- "When can we get started?"
- "What's the next step?"
- "Do you work with businesses like ours?"
- "What do I need to do to get started?"
- "Can you customize this?"
- "What happens after I sign?"

#### Non-Verbal Signals (They're Ready to Buy)

- Leaning forward (engaged)
- Nodding (agreeing)
- Taking notes (serious)
- Asking about implementation (ready to move forward)
- Pulling out calendar (checking availability)

#### Red Flags (They're NOT Ready)

- Arms crossed (defensive)
- Checking phone repeatedly (disengaged)
- Looking away (not interested)
- "Let me think about it" (without specific concerns)
- Asking same question repeatedly (not understanding or not buying)
- Talking about competitors (shopping around, not serious about you)

**If You See Red Flags:**
- Pause and address: "I can tell you're not 100% sold. What's the main concern?"
- Don't force close—you'll get a cancellation or refund request

### 10.3 The 7-Touch Follow-Up Sequence

### 10.4 Follow-Up Best Practices

#### Timing Matters

**Best Times to Follow Up:**
- Morning: 9-11 AM (decision-makers are fresh)
- Afternoon: 2-4 PM (after lunch, before end of day)
- Tuesday-Thursday: Best response rates
- Monday: Too busy, catching up
- Friday: End of week, minds elsewhere

**Response Time:**
- Hot leads: Respond within 5 minutes
- Warm leads: Respond within 2 hours
- Cold leads: Follow up within 24 hours

#### Personalization

**Don't:** Send generic "Hey, just following up" messages

**Do:** Reference specific conversations, pain points, or offers

**Example:**
❌ *"Hi, just following up on our call. Are you interested?"*

✅ *"Hi [Name], I was thinking about our conversation about [specific pain point]. I found a case study that's exactly like your situation—want me to send it?"*

#### Multi-Channel Approach

**Don't:** Only use email

**Do:** Mix channels (email, phone, text, LinkedIn)

**Example Sequence:**
- Day 1: Email (proposal)
- Day 2: LinkedIn message (value add)
- Day 4: Text (quick check-in)
- Day 7: Phone call (personal touch)
- Day 10: Email (case study)

#### Value-First

**Don't:** Just ask "Are you ready to buy?"

**Do:** Always provide value before asking

**Example:**
❌ *"Hi, are you ready to move forward?"*

✅ *"Hi, I found a case study that's perfect for your situation. Here it is. Also, are you ready to move forward?"*

## Chapter 12: Performance Tracking, Commissions, and KPIs

### 12.1 Commission Structure

#### Initial Sale Commission

**Rate:** 30% of gross revenue from initial sale

**When Paid:** Within 30 days of client payment

**Example:**
- Premium Package: ,500/month × 12 months = ,000 initial
- Your commission: ,000 × 30% = **,400**

**Important:** You don't get paid until client pays. If client delays payment, your commission is delayed.

#### Monthly Residual Commission

**Rate:** 15% of monthly recurring revenue

**Duration:** For life of client contract (typically 12 months, some longer)

**Example:**
- Premium Package: ,500/month
- Your residual: ,500 × 15% = **/month**
- Over 12 months:  × 12 = **,700**

**When Paid:** Monthly, on 15th of following month (e.g., January residual paid February 15)

**Important:** Residuals continue as long as client is active. If client cancels, residuals stop.

#### Bonus Structure

**Activity Bonuses:**
-  bonus for 100 dials in a week
-  bonus for 200 dials in a week
-  bonus for 7 demos in a week
-  bonus for 10+ demos in a week

**Performance Bonuses:**
-  bonus per referral that closes
-  bonus for 5 closes in a month
- ,000 bonus for 10 closes in a month
- ,000 bonus for + in commissions in a month

**When Paid:** Same cycle as regular commissions

#### Commission Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Starter Package + Insurance Bundle**
- Digital Starter: /mo × 12 = ,600
- Insurance Bundle: /mo × 12 = ,600
- Total Initial: ,200
- Initial Commission: ,200 × 30% = **,960**
- Monthly Residual: ( + ) × 15% = **/month**
- Year 1 Total: ,960 + ( × 12) = **,940**

**Example 2: Premium Package Only**
- Premium: ,500/mo × 12 = ,000
- Initial Commission: ,000 × 30% = **,400**
- Monthly Residual: ,500 × 15% = **/month**
- Year 1 Total: ,400 + ( × 12) = **,100**

**Example 3: Top Performer Month (3 Premium Bundles)**
- 3 × ,200 = ,600 total initial
- Initial Commission: ,600 × 30% = **,880**
- Monthly Residuals: 3 ×  = **/month**
- Month 1 Total: **,375**
