# Vercel Configuration Merge - Complete

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Merged

---

## What Was Merged

All TNR Vercel project configurations have been consolidated into a single unified `vercel.json` file.

### Previously Separate Configs:
1. **vercel.json** (Main) - API functions, rewrites, build command
2. **vercel-caching.json** - Caching headers for assets and static files
3. **vercel-legal.json** - Security headers and legal pages routing
4. **tnr-legal-deploy/vercel.json** - Separate legal pages deployment

### Unified Configuration Now Includes:

#### Build & Functions
- Build command: `node verify-images.js`
- API functions configuration (1024MB memory, 10s max duration)

#### Rewrites
- `/submit-form` → `/api/submit-form`
- `/checkout` → `/api/checkout`

#### Security Headers (Applied to All Pages)
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

#### Caching Headers (Optimized Performance)
- **Static Assets** (`/assets/*`, images, CSS, JS, fonts): 
  - `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` (1 year)
- **Media Files** (`/media/*`): 
  - `Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000` (30 days)
- **HTML Pages** (`*.html`): 
  - `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600` (1 hour)
- **API Endpoints** (`/api/*`, `/submit-form`, `/checkout`): 
  - `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` (no cache)

## Old Configuration Files

Old config files have been moved to `vercel-configs-archive/` for reference:
- `vercel-caching.json` - Archived
- `vercel-legal.json` - Archived

---

## Deployment

The unified configuration is deployed to:
- **Project Name:** tnr-business-solutions
- **Project ID:** prj_UySLruuI8nrDcHHTHtOQLO0F5FlS

All features from separate configs are now active in a single deployment.

---

## Benefits

1. ✅ Single source of truth for Vercel configuration
2. ✅ Simplified maintenance
3. ✅ All security and caching headers active
4. ✅ Optimized performance with proper cache headers
5. ✅ API functions properly configured

---

## Notes

- The `tnr-legal-deploy` folder is kept for reference but is no longer needed for deployment
- Legal pages (privacy-policy.html, terms-conditions.html) are already in the main site root
- All configurations are backward compatible
