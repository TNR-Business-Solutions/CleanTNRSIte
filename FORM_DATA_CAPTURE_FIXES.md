# 🎯 Form Data Capture Fixes - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL FORMS FIXED & DEPLOYED

---

## 🚨 **Problem Solved**

**Issue:** Form submissions were not capturing all data - many fields showed "Not provided" in CRM and email notifications.

**Root Cause:** Missing `name` attributes on form fields prevented data from being captured by `FormData` API.

**Solution:** Added `name` attributes to ALL form fields across all insurance forms.
