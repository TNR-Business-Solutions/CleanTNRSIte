# 🔧 404 Error Fix

## Issue
Getting `404: NOT_FOUND` errors from Vercel, likely because:
1. Route not matching in `api/[...all].js`
2. Missing route configuration in `vercel.json`
3. Handler not being found or loaded

## Fix Applied
1. ✅ Improved 404 error handling in `api/[...all].js`
2. ✅ Added proper headers before sending 404 response
3. ✅ Added CORS headers to 404 responses
4. ✅ Enhanced logging to debug routing issues

## Common Routes That Might 404

### If accessing `/api/social-tokens` (with hyphen):
- **Fix**: Use `/api/social/tokens` (with slash)
- The route is `/api/social/tokens`, not `/api/social-tokens`

### If accessing a route not in the list:
- Check `api/[...all].js` for available routes
- Add route handler if needed
- Update `vercel.json` if needed

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Vercel Logs**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Logs
   - Look for "Route not found" messages
   - Check the `route`, `pathname`, and `url` values

2. **Check Route Matching**:
   - The route should match patterns in `api/[...all].js`
   - Routes are matched in order (most specific first)

3. **Verify Handler Exists**:
   - Check that the handler file exists in `server/handlers/`
   - Verify the handler exports correctly

## Next Steps

If you're still getting 404 errors:
1. Share the exact URL that's 404ing
2. Check Vercel function logs for routing details
3. Verify the route is in the available routes list
